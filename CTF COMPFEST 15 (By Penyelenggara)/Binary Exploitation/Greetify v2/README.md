# Greetify v2 [500 pts]

**Solves:** 0

## Description
>b"Because Im feeling lonely, I created an application to greet me once again. However, I realized that Im not the only one who is feeling lonely, so I modified it to be able to greet anyone. Nevertheless, Im unsure about its safety. Could you please help me check it?\r\n\r\n**P.S: Due to limitations on my server, each session is restricted to a duration of 5 seconds \xe2\x98\xb9\xef\xb8\x8f (to simulate this behavior, run the binary with this command: `timeout 5 ./chall`)**\r\n\r\n`nc 34.101.122.7 10000`\r\n\r\n**Author: NeoZap**"

**Hint**
* b"Take a closer look at `readnline()`\n* 4+4=8, no?\n* Bothered by `strlen() <= 9` constraint? Check this screenshot I took from https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1120336314361991182/1147501598587764806/image.png)\nYou should be able to get 4 byte arbitrary write...\n* 5 seconds timeout is annoying? If you saw my previous hint, you should be able to get 4 byte arbitrary write, right? \n4 byte write may be too slow in some cases, but if you are able to write 4 bytes, why cant you write **less** bytes?"
