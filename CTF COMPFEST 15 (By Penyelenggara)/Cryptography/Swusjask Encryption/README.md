## Description
>One day swusjask woke up and decided to be cryptography researcher. Suddenly, he came up with mind that he want to create some encryption scheme like RSA.\r\nRSA is widely known and used as cryptography encryption scheme and work in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%7BZ%7D_n) under multiplication. So he came up with mind that "Why I not make encryption scheme more complicated to improve security". So he decided to make encryption scheme under ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%7BZ%7D_n%20%5Ctimes%20%7BZ%7D_n) with own defined multiplication operation. But, the problem is he forgot to make decryption scheme \xf0\x9f\x98\x94.\r\n\r\n**Author: swusjask**

**Hint**
* Like RSA, the key behind decryption is to find order of group. Can you find it?\n* consider isomorphism (mapping) between this group and multiplicative group modulo polynomial with degree 2 and deduce the order\n* ![png.png](/files/3d47c8e4e2fa6e3ebc3d0da0704e1103/png.png)
