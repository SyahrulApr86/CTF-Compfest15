I can assure you I did have a date with her. Otherwise, how would I take this picture?!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I organize my dating pictures by location. The problem is, I forgot the name of the street where I took this picture, specifically the street behind her. And the girl? Well, long story, but there\u2019s no way I can ask her. All I can remember is this location was near a Burberry store. I tried to look it up too, but the streets and buildings were pretty hard to recognize because the pictures on the internet were from 5 years ago.\r\n\r\nI know you can find the street location.
