[416 pts] Intro to SysAdmin
Description
Author: rorre

Welcome to the world of sysadmin! Our postgresql server was hacked, can you check out what's happening here?

Requirements:

A linux system! VM or WSL (should) work too

Getting into the system:

Open your terminal
Enter your root shell
Extract the tar file with tar -xf debian.tar.gz
Set the root variable environment for convenience export DEBROOT=$PWD/debian
WARNING

Please ENSURE that the variable is SET CORRECTLY, or else your system might be broken! You can check this by running echo $DEBROOT and see if the variable has been indeed set.

Set up all the required Virtual Kernel FS
mount -v --bind /dev $DEBROOT/dev
mount -v --bind /dev/pts $DEBROOT/dev/pts
mount -vt proc proc $DEBROOT/proc
mount -vt sysfs sysfs $DEBROOT/sys
mount -vt tmpfs tmpfs $DEBROOT/run
Go inside the chroot
chroot "$DEBROOT" /usr/bin/env -i   \
    HOME=/root                      \
    TERM="$TERM"                    \
    PS1='(root chroot) \u:\w\$ '    \
    PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin         \
    /bin/bash --login
If you see that you are root, now you are in the chroot environment. Happy hacking!

Hints
# The hacker attacks postgresql, maybe check there?

# Try looking at all the databases and tables
